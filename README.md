# Feedback Infavors the Generalization of Neural ODEs

This document describes how to use the codes of feedback neural networks presented in the paper [1]. A toy example is first introduced to illustrate the basic idea of feedback neural networks. Then all codes to reproduce three implemented tests in the paper [1] are provided. The implemented tests include trajectory prediction of a spiral_curve, trajectory prediction of an irregular object, and model predictive control of the quadrotor.

## Installation

```python
pip install numpy==1.23.5
pip install torch
pip install torchdiffeq
pip install matplotlib
```

## Toy example

The toy example is placed in the **toy_example** repository.

#### 1. Neural ODE with a linear feedback

Consider a spiral curve:
\[
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{\dot {x}}\\
{\dot {y}}
\end{array}} \right] = \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{ {- 0.1}}&{2}\\
{ - 2}&{- 0.1}
\end{array}} \right]\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{x}\\
{y}
\end{array}} \right]
\]
Neural ODE [2] can learn its latent dynamics accurately with collected dataset $\{x_i,y_i\}$:

However,  as the learned ODE model is employed in a new case:
$$
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{\dot {x}}\\{\dot {y}}\end{array}} \right] = \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{ {- 0.05}}&{3}\\{ - 3}&{- 0.05}\end{array}} \right]\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{x}\\{y}\end{array}} \right]+\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{10}\\{10}\end{array}} \right]
$$
the learning performance of latent dynamics will degrade:

<img src="png_readme\Neural_ODE_in_testing.png" alt="Neural_ODE_in_testing" style="zoom:25%;" />

With the proposed linear feedback form, the trained model by neural ODE can generalize to the new case very well:

<img src="png_readme\FNN_in_testing.png" alt="FNN_in_testing" style="zoom:25%;" />

which further improves the trajectory prediction performance:

Run followed code in the terminal to obtain the above results.

```
python linear_feedback.py --viz
```

#### 2. Neural ODE with a neural feedback

A linear feedback form can promptly improve the adaptability of neural ODEs in unseen scenarios. However, two improvements could be further made. At first, it would be more practical if the gain tuning procedure could be avoided. Moreover, the linear feedback form can be extended to a nonlinear one to adopt more intricate scenes, as experienced in the control field. Thus in this part, we try to learn a neural feedback.

Domain randomization can improve the generalization ability for sim-to-real missions. However, the training objective is forced to focus on the average performance among different parameters, such that the prediction ability on the previous nominal task (1) will degraded:

<img src="png_readme\Neural_ODE_withDR_in_training.png" alt="Neural_ODE_withDR_in_training" style="zoom: 40%;" />

Run followed code in the terminal to obtain the above result.

```
python neural_ODE_withDR.py --viz
```

Run followed code in the terminal to train the neural Feedback.

```
python neural_feedback.py --viz
```

With the neural feedback, not only the accuracy performance on  the previous nominal task (1) can be maintained:

<img src="png_readme\Neural_ODE_withNF_in_training.png" alt="Neural_ODE_withNF_in_training" style="zoom:40%;" />

but also the generalization on new cases can be achieved:

<img src="png_readme\Neural_ODE_withNF_in_testing.png" alt="Neural_ODE_withNF_in_testing" style="zoom: 20%;" />

Run followed code in the terminal to obtain the above result.

```
python neural_feedback_test.py --viz
```

#### 2. Trajectory prediction of an irregular object

Github repository link: https://github.com/anonymity-tempo/Feedback_NN_irregular_object.git

Precise trajectory prediction of a free-flying irregular object is a challenging task due to the complicated aerodynamic effects.  We test the effectiveness of the proposed method on an open-source dataset, in comparison with the model-based method and the learning-based method. The objective of this mission is to accurately predict the object's position after $0.5\ s$.

#### 3. Model predictive control of the quadrotor

Github repository link: https://github.com/anonymity-tempo/Feedback_NN_MPC.git

MPC works in the form of receding-horizon trajectory optimizations with a dynamic model and then determines the current optimal control input. Approving optimization results highly rely on accurate dynamical models. The proposed feedback neural network is employed on the quadrotor trajectory tracking scenario concerning model uncertainties and external disturbances, to demonstrate its online adaptive capability. 

The adjoint sensitive method is employed in [2] to train neural ODEs without considering external inputs. We provide an alternative training strategy in the presence of external inputs, from the view of optimal control.
